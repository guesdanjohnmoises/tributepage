        Francis Gatilowan — a passionate learner, dreamer, and future leader aiming to make a difference in his community.
      </p>

      <p>
        Born on December 17, 1978 in Bauko, Mountain Province, Philippines, Francis grew up with a strong determination to rise above challenges. 
        From a young age, he dreamed of becoming a professional IT developer, driven by curiosity, discipline, and the desire to create meaningful solutions through technology. 
        One of his greatest aspirations is to study at the University of the Cordilleras (UC), a school known for shaping some of the finest minds in the region. 
      </p>

      <p>
        But his dreams don’t end there — Francis hopes to serve as a congressman one day, using his voice and experience to help uplift the poor and bring positive change to the Cordilleras. 
        His journey reflects resilience, ambition, and a heart dedicated to service.
      </p>

      <p>
        His story continues to inspire me as a student — a reminder that no dream is too big when you carry perseverance, passion, and purpose.
